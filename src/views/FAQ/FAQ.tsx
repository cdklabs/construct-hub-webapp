              It is a central destination to discover and share cloud
              application design patterns and reference architectures defined
              for the AWS CDK, CDK for Kubernetes (CDK8s), CDK for Terraform
              (CDKtf) and any other construct-based tool.

          <FAQItem question="Why should I use Construct Hub?">
            <p>
              Construct Hub is built to serve the community that uses the
              constructs programming model (CPM) and to allow them find publicly
              available constructs they can reuse. Before the Construct Hub,
              developers did not have an easy way to discover construct
              libraries created by the community since they were published
              across various package managers and without a central index.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Construct Hub is a central, trusted venue CDK developers can
              use to discover published constructs to help them build their
              applications. In the Dev Preview Construct Hub you can discover
              constructs in TypeScript and Python and read their documentation
              and improved API reference in the programming language that the
              package supports.
            </p>
          </FAQItem>
          <FAQItem question="How can I add my construct to the Construct Hub?">
            <p>
              In order to add your construct to the Construct Hub, you will need
              to publish it to the{" "}
              <FAQLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.com</FAQLink>{" "}
              registry, use a permissive license (Apache, BSD, MIT), and
              annotate it with one of the supported keywords (aws-cdk, cdk8s or
              cdktf).
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, since one of the main goals of the Construct Hub is
              to enable an ecosystem of constructs that can be consumed by all
              CDK languages, your library <strong>must</strong> be compiled with{" "}
              <FAQLink href="https://aws.github.io/jsii/">JSII</FAQLink>, which
              is is a TypeScript-based programming language for creating
              multi-language libraries. The Construct Hub uses the type
              information produced by the JSII compiler in order to render the
              rich multi-language API reference displayed at the Construct Hub.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Construct Hub monitors all updates to the npm Registry and
              will list any packages that meet the above requirements within
              5-10 minutes. If your package does not appear in the Construct
              Hub, please file an issue on our GitHub repository.
            </p>

          <FAQItem question="What is a construct?">
            <p>
              The Constructs Programming Model (CPM) introduces the notion of{" "}
              <strong>constructs</strong>, which represent cloud building blocks
              that can be used to assemble complete applications of any
              complexity. AWS, enterprises, start-ups, and individual developers
              use CDK constructs to share proven architecture patterns as
              reusable code libraries, so that everyone can benefit from the
              collective wisdom of the community.

          </FAQItem>
          <FAQItem question="Who owns the constructs in the Construct Hub?">
            <p>
              The constructs are owned by the publishers of the packages.
              Constructs are user generated content that are governed by their
              own license terms which is displayed in the search results and can
              be accessed directly through the hyperlinked package page.

          <FAQItem question="Is the content served in Construct Hub meant to be consumed programmatically?">
            <p>
              No. The content displayed in the site is user generated, with some
              display formatting. We do not advise that you consume constructs
              from the search results programmatically. Please note that

            <p>
              For each package you can click the repository link that the
              publisher provided with the package. Theoretically this link
              should redirect your to the package’s repository. However, we
              noticed that sometimes the code in the repository can be more or
              less updated than the package’s code. Please take that into
              account.

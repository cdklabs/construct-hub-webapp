            You are encouraged to contribute to the construct ecosystem by
            publishing CDK libraries, contributing code to Construct Hub and
            providing us and libraries’ publishers feedback. For more

          <FAQItem question="What is Construct Hub?">
            <p>
              Construct Hub is a place to discover CDK constructs &mdash; a
              central destination for discovering and sharing cloud application
              design patterns and reference architectures defined for the AWS
              CDK, CDK for Kubernetes (CDK8s), CDK for Terraform (CDKtf) and
              other construct-based tools.

          <FAQItem question="Why should I use Construct Hub?">
            <Text>
              Construct Hub is a central venue where CDK developers can discover
              construct libraries to help them build their applications. You can
              find construct libraries in TypeScript, Python, Java and .NET (Go
              is coming soon!), browse their developer guides and API
              references, and explore code samples in all the programming
              language that the package supports.

          <FAQItem question="What is a construct?">
            <Text>
              The Constructs Programming Model (CPM) introduces the notion of{" "}
              <strong>constructs</strong>, which represent building blocks that
              can be used to assemble complete cloud applications of any
              complexity. AWS, enterprises, startups, and individual developers
              use CDK constructs to share proven architecture patterns as
              reusable code libraries, so that everyone can benefit from the
              collective wisdom of the community.

          <FAQItem question="What are the prerequisites for using a construct library?">
            <Text>
              To use a construct library in your code, you need to have your
              preferred programming language installed. In order to synthesize,
              diff, and deploy collections of resources you will need to install
              the CDK Toolkit command-line tool. For AWS CDK install the{" "}

            </Text>
            <Text>
              The CDK8s CLI doesn’t require having any registered account nor
              having a running Kubernetes cluster as it only updates Kubernetes
              manifests.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              The CDKtf CLI requires having Terraform, Node, Yarn and Docker
              installed.

            <Text>
              Some construct libraries’ documentation may include additional
              prerequisites which are unique to their implementation.

          <FAQItem question="Who owns the constructs in Construct Hub?">
            <Text>
              Constructs are user-generated content owned by the publishers of
              the individual packages. Each is governed by its own license terms
              chosen by its publisher (although only packages that were
              published to the NPM registry under Apache, BSD, EPL, MPL-2.0, ISC
              and CDDL or MIT open source licenses are included in Construct
              Hub). License information can be accessed directly through the
              hyperlinked package page.

          <FAQItem question="Is the content served in Construct Hub meant to be consumed programmatically?">
            <Text>
              No. The content displayed in the site is user-generated, with some

            <Text>
              Construct Hub currently has constructs for the CDK for
              CloudFormation (AWS CDK), CDK for Kubernetes (CDK8s) and CDK for
              Terraform (CDKtf). We are open to adding other construct-based

          <FAQItem question="What is CDK for CloudFormation (AWS CDK)?">
            <Text>
              CDK for CloudFormation (AWS CDK) is an open-source software
              development framework for defining applications on AWS and
              reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages and
              rich object-oriented APIs. AWS CDK apps synthesize into standard
              AWS CloudFormation templates, which can be deployed to create
              infrastructure on AWS. See{" "}

              CDK for Kubernetes (CDK8s, pronounced “cd kates”) is an
              open-source software development framework for defining Kubernetes
              applications and reusable abstractions using familiar programming
              languages and rich object-oriented APIs. CDK8s apps synthesize
              into standard Kubernetes manifests that can be applied to any
              Kubernetes cluster. See{" "}

              The community preview of the Cloud Development Kit for Terraform
              (CDKtf) allows you to define infrastructure using a familiar
              programming language such as TypeScript, Python, or Go, while

          <FAQItem question="Can I view the source code of a construct?">
            <Text>
              Source code is usually available via the repository link provided
              by the construct’s publisher; this link appears on Construct Hub.
              We have noticed that the code in the linked repository can
              sometimes be newer or older than the code in the published
              package, so exercise care.

          <FAQItem question="How can I install a package?">
            <Text>
              The details vary by construct. Click “Install” in the package page

            <Text>
              Your trust is vital to the success of Construct Hub. If you
              believe a package contains suspicious code, violates its
              dependencies’ licenses, or is otherwise not behaving as a good
              citizen of the community, click &quot;Report abuse&quot; at the
              bottom of the package page and send us an email with explanations
              and evidence to support your claims. If we can verify the issue,
              we will take appropriate action, up to and including removing the
              package from Construct Hub.

          <FAQItem question="How can I report a bug or contribute code to a construct?">
            <Text>
              Each package is owned by its publisher, so contributions, such as
              bug reports and pull requests, should be made via the repository
              link provided by the publisher. You may press the &quot;Provide
              feedback&quot; link at the package page to open a new issue in the
              package’s repository.

          <FAQItem question="Why isn’t my package displayed on Construct Hub?">
            <Text>
              Construct Hub includes publicly-available constructs that are
              JSII-compatible and that were published to the npm Registry under
              Apache, BSD, EPL, MPL-2.0, ISC and CDDL or MIT open source
              licenses and with a CDK keyword: aws-cdk, cdk8s, or cdktf. If you
              believe your package qualifies, but it still does not appear in
              Construct Hub, please raise an issue{" "}

              Yes, you can and should! After you publish a new valid version to
              the public npm Registry, it should appear on Construct Hub in
              about 30 minutes.

          <FAQItem question="How does Construct Hub relates to the Construct Catalog?">
            <Text>
              The Construct Catalog was built by the CDK community in
              collaboration with the AWS CDK team. Construct Hub is the official
              version of the Construct Catalog with ongoing support by the AWS
              CDK team and essentially replaces the Construct Catalog.{" "}
